                                                          Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning





                                                          

Overview:


This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. We employed several classical machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting, to build predictive models.
