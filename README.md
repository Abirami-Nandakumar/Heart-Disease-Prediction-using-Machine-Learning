                                                          Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning





                                                          

Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease in patients based on various medical attributes. We employed several classical machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree, XGBoost, and Gradient Boosting, to build predictive models.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "Heart Disease UCI" dataset, sourced from Kaggle. It contains various attributes such as age, sex, chest pain type, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol levels, maximum heart rate achieved, and more. The target variable indicates the presence or absence of heart disease.

Approach
Data Preprocessing
Before building the predictive models, we performed extensive data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Building
We implemented the following machine learning algorithms:

Logistic Regression (LR)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Random Forest (RF)
Decision Tree
XGBoost
Gradient Boosting
Each model was trained using the preprocessed dataset to predict the presence of heart disease.

Model Evaluation
We evaluated the performance of each model using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Additionally, we employed techniques like cross-validation to ensure the robustness of the models.

Results and Insights
We compared the performance of all models and drew insights regarding their effectiveness in predicting heart disease. Visualizations were utilized to showcase important features and decision boundaries.

Usage
The code provided in this repository can be used to reproduce the results and further explore the dataset and models. Detailed instructions are provided in the Jupyter Notebook.
